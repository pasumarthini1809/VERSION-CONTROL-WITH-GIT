*DISCREPTION*
   The code uses subprocess.run() to execute Git commands as if they were typed into the command line. The cwd argument specifies the working directory for the Git commands, ensuring they are executed within the correct repository. The check=True argument raises a subprocess.CalledProcessError if a Git command fails, allowing for error handling.
Example Usage:
The example usage at the end of the script demonstrates how to create a repository, add and commit files, create and switch branches, and merge branches.
Benefits:
Automation: Automate Git tasks within Python scripts.
Integration: Integrate Git functionality into larger Python applications.
Scripting: Create custom Git workflows using Python.
Error Handling: Provides error handling for Git commands.
